To make the lives easier on us maintainers, please help out:

- Be sure to describe what your PR is, and feel free to ask for help along the way.
- Follow the coding style used in other files. Being in the neighborhood is good enough.
- If you're contributing a transaction set definition, please include examples in `spec/fixtures`. This will automatically create specs to test your definition. You can remove confidential information using `bin/edi-obfuscate`.
- If you're contributing code (apart from definitions), please include specs so we won't accidentally break your code in the future. Sometimes adding specs won't make sense, or it won't be worth it, so ask if you aren't sure!

Thank you for contributing!
